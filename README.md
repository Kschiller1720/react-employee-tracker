User Story

As a user, I want to be able to view my entire employee directory at once so that I have quick access to their information.


Business Context
An employee or manager would benefit greatly from being able to view non-sensitive data about other employees. It would be particularly helpful to be able to filter employees by name.

Acceptance Criteria
Given a table of random users, when the user loads the page, a table of employees should render.
The user should be able to:
-Sort the table by at least one category
-Filter the users by at least one property

Instructions:
Download zip or clone file to local directory
npm install
npm start

Application should open up on port 3000
If not open browser and go to localhost:3000
